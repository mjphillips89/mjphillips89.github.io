					<h2>GE Memorial Site</h2>

					<h3>Overview:</h3>  
					<p class="voice"> When a recent tragedy occurred within the company, employees across GE and members of the CX team struggled with the rapid design and deployment of a website that would allow employees to share their thoughts, memories, and stories of their fellow employee.</br> 

					As part of a three-person team, we were tasked with the research, design, and implementation of a set of templates that would allow GE to timely deploy a site for employees to share information and allow for comments.</p>
					

					<h3>Background Research:</h3>

					<p class="voice">Given the emotionally charged subject matter, an extensive analysis of various online memorials, disasters, and obituary sites were reviewed. The analysis included an inventory on the types of features, call to action, and content of the site.   
					</p>
					<h3>Defining Scenarios:</h3>
					<p class="voice">Based on this research, several scenarios were used to create a set of visual elements, features and text that accompanied each scenario. Each scenario was well defined, with lists of visual elements, consideration for user emotions, appropriate layout and page elements. 
					</p>

  						<figcaption>Spreadsheets used for inventory and defining scenarios</figcaption>
					</figure>

					<h3>Design Phase:</h3>
					<p class="voice">After the research phase, actual templates were designed. I was in charge of the layout, and interactions of the templates. I worked closely with the visual designer of the team to ensure that my layouts and interactions aligned with the visual design elements of the page. Each scenario was compiled into a final prototype with a thorough style and design guide so it could be handed off to the front-end developer on our team.</p>

					<h3>Outcome:</h3>
					<p class="voice">We were able to successfully define, and create a set of designs that could be instantaneously used in the event of a tragedy. In the future, these templates will allow for quick usage, focusing on the content of the page rather than on the design. </p>

					<h2>GE MyAccounts Consumer Awareness Page Development:</h2>

					<h3>Overview:</h3>  
					<p class="voice"> 
					My first project for the Customer Experience Team was the design and development of a Consumer Awareness page for the GE MyAccounts.  This page is used to provide GE MyAccounts users with resources and FAQ’s in regards to the site.</p>

					<h3> Wireframes:</h3>
					<p class="voice">Utilizing the provided business requirements, my first task was to iterate through possible methods of laying out the help information. The final design consolidated four pages of content onto a single page which simplified navigation and access to content.</p>

					<h2>GE TechU Hackathon:</h2> 

					<h3>Overview:</h3>
					<p class="voice">During my internship I was given the opportunity to participate in the GE TechU Hackathon. The rules of the Hackathon were to create a geospatial application over the 48 hours allocated for the competition.</p>

					<h3>Deliverable:</h3>
					<p class="voice">Our team created GE HealthFinder, an app that could assist GE Healthcare customers in selecting products and equipment that would be beneficial for the hospitals, clinics, and/or offices in their area. Selections were based on demographics, health and medical related geographic data.</p>

					<h3>My Role:</h3>
					<p class="voice">My role on the team was to design the layout and architecture features, as well as, oversee the overall aesthetic of the app. I achieved this through the creation of a user flow guide for the interactions within the app and implemented these designs and interactions through HTML and CSS.</p> 

					<h3>Outcome:</h3>
					<p class="voice">After the 48 hours of collaboration, design, and development, our application won best design and best overall app in the competition. The TechU Hackathon provided great experience on how working on a team with an extremely rapid deadline, and how it affects design decisions and development of an application.</p>

					<h2>ServiceNow Prototyping:</h2> 

					<h3>Overview:</h3>
					<p class="voice">The majority of my first rotation was spent assisting in prototyping and documentation for the employee facing web portal ServiceNow. My role was to create and document prototypes and user interface elements for ServiceNow pages and forms. 
					</p>

					<h3>Process:</h3>
					<p class="voice">Before creating the prototypes for each page, requirements were gathered from the business analyst’s team. Guidelines for questions, text, actions required on the forms and pages were developed. In order to ensure quality layout and design of forms, I frequently consulted Luke Wroblewksi’s Filling in the Blanks.</br> 
					UI elements and prototypes were presented to the quality assurance team members and other CX team designers frequently to gather feedback and to ensure that the requirements were met. Upon approval, UI elements, interactions, styles and mobile layouts were thoroughly documented for a third party developer to accurately translate prototypes into production ready code.</p>

					<h3>Interviews, Personas and Scenarios:</h3> 
					<p class="voice">Over the course of two weeks we recruited and interviewed five users of the website. Questions were asked based on how they used the website, their information needs and motivations, as well as, their general computer and internet use.</p>
					<h4>Key Findings</h4>
					<div class="list">
						<ol class="list">
							<li>Users have a strong need to know when peonies are in bloom</li>
							<li>Accurate and detailed information on where to park when visiting the Peony Garden is important to garden members</li>

				<div class="process">
					<h3>User Surveys:</h3> 
					<p class="voice"> Using Qualtrics, a survey was created that asked users about their general habits, needs, and expectations while using the internet, as well as, researching peonies, or trying to visit a peony garden website. The responses were used to help frame user expectations when visiting the Peony Garden Website. </p>
					<h4>Key Findings:</h4>
					<div class="list">
						<ol class="list">
							<li>Most useful types of information on a public garden website are the types of flowers in the garden, when they are in bloom, and information on events at the garden</li>
							<li>Before visiting a public garden, participants primarily find parking
							information on the garden’s website</li>
							<li>The most important reasons people visit public gardens are for fun/entertainment, to learn more about different types of plants and flowers, and to get ideas for their own garden</li>
							<li> Photos of peonies and peony expert Q&A or FAQ sections are the
							website features found to be most useful to respondents who research peonies </li>
						</ol>
					</div>

					</figure>
				</div>
				<div class="process">
					<h3>Heuristic Evaluation:</h3> 
					<p class="voice"> Utilizing Nielsen’s 10 Heuristics for User Interface Design usability issues on the website were identified. Each heuristic violation was ranked on a scale of 0 to 4  with low score for non-existent to a high for major usability issues hindering use of the website.</p>
					<h4>Key Findings:</h4>
					<p class="voice">While a majority of the heuristic violations were minor, we did find key issues with user control and freedom, consistency and standards, as well as allowing users to recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors.</p> 

				</div>
				<div class="process">
					<h3>Comparitive Analysis:</h3> 
					<p class="voice"> The UofM Peony Garden Website was compared to five other websites based off of Newman’s Taxonomy. Each website was evaluated on organization, aesthetic, features, and usability. This helped give insight on how similar websites conveyed information to their users.</p>
					<h4>Key Findings</h4>
					<div class="list">
						<ol class="list">
							<li>The UM Peony Garden site does not provide event information on its homepage slider like other garden websites do.</li>
							<li>Unlike some of its competitors, the UM Peony Garden’s website does not have a dedicated events page.</li>
							<li>Compared to its competitors, the UM Peony Garden’s website lacks diversity in its images.</li>
							<li>The UM Peony Garden’s online peony database is an excellent resource for researching peonies in comparison to its competitors’ databases or catalogs.</li>

					<h3>Usability Testing:</h3> 
					<p class="voice"> For this task, five Peony Garden visitors were recruited to use the site. During testing three scenarios were created for the users to walk through. Included in the process was a note-taker and moderator, which were responsible for reading the script, describing tasks, and giving the questionnaires. The tests were designed based on the processes laid out by Rubin and Chisnell in Handbook of Usability Testing: How to Plan, Design, and Conduct Effective Tests. (Rubin & Chisnell, 2008) </p>

					<h4>Recruiting:</h4>
					<p class="voice">Prior to the initial interview study, the staff at the Peony Garden sent out an e-mail to the MBGNA listserv asking for volunteers who would be willing to help evaluate the site by taking part in interviews, taking our survey, and finally, performing usability tests. The participants who indicated to the garden staff that they would be willing to participate in in-person usability tests were contacted by our group via e-mail. We chose volunteers who had both not participated in the interview study and whose schedules worked well with our team’s availability.</p>

					<h4>Example Tasks:</h4>
					<p class="voice">“You have fond memories of the French peonies your parents grew in their garden while you were growing up. You know that Nichols Arboretum has a peony garden and before visiting it, you are curious to see if there are any French peonies currently in bloom there. Find a way to look for French peonies that are in bloom at the garden on the Peony Garden Website.”</p>
					<p class="voice">“On your last visit to the UM Peony Garden, you found a peony that you really liked called the “Duchess of Portland.” You want to show your friend Sally where the peony is in the garden. You think you remember seeing it in a bed near the garden’s Reader Center. Go to the Peony Garden Website to confirm the exact location of this peony.”</p>

					<h4>Key Findings:</h4>
					<div class="list">
						<ol class="list">
							<li>Participants could not easily find flowers that are currently in bloom at the Peony Garden through the database.</li>
							<li>The Peony Database search results provide information on peonies that users do not find helpful.</li>
							<li>Users are unwilling to click through all of the links on the Peony Garden Photo Maps page.</li>
							<li>There is no direct link between a result in the database and the Peony Garden photo maps.</li>
						</ol>
					</div>

				</div>
				<div class="process">
					<h3>Findings & Outcomes:</h3> 
					<p class="voice"> For each of the six tasks during our websites evaluation, we generated findings, recommendations and into a report given to our client. We also generated a set of overall findings and recommendations, which were presented to the U of M Peony Garden staff and developers. The recommendations helped the garden to make changes to their website which would allow users quicker access to vital information.</p>

					The findings from the evaluation prompted the team to redesign the navigation and landing page as the first phase in the portal redesign. Citing the evaluation, a new navigation menu was designed to allow users to easily find the correct forms based on application type. The new site also migrated important documents and pertinent information to the landing page for quick and easy access. 
					The portal was developed using Bootstrap, Html, CSS, Javascript, and Backbase Portal Server. As a team member I consistently met agile deadlines for developing features and functionality of the web portal.

					<h3>Takeaways:</h3> 
					<p class="voice"> 
					My rotation ended before the launch of the first phase of the portal and I was not able to evaluate the effectiveness of the redesign. However, I was able to evaluate the shortcomings of an existing web portal and use these findings to create a more simplistic design, layout, and navigation for the new SCWC.

					<h3>PLMi Migration Project:</h3> 
					<p class="voice"> Along with the redesign of the SCWC I was also a part of another team project. PLMi is an online database used by Aviation Supply Chain to inventory and track parts being used on the factory floor.  My role in this project was to set up meetings with stakeholders to gather information in order to create, edit and move SQL queries from their old database into their new, more accessible online database.
					</p> 
					<p class="voice"> The migration of the queries reduced time, costs, and resources by factory managers who needed periodic access to supply chain metrics.  The process was well documented over the course of my internship and this documentation was used to create a guide to help future employees create and migrate queries into their online database.

					Within JATA, there was a lack of easily accessible infrastructure to get information on the status of bus service. This caused missed opportunities for increased ridership and lack of clarity among current ridership. 
					</p>
					<h3>Goal:</h3>
					<p class="voice">The goal was to identify and deliver solutions in order help facilitate better communication of transit routes, schedules, and delays, to current and potential riders. This included the design of route signage and an online schedule. 
	  				</p>
  				</div>
  				<div class="process">
				<h3>Stakeholder Meetings (Requirements Gathering)</h3>
					<p class="voice">
					To kick-off the process, we met with our partners in Jackson to discuss the major issues faced with bus transportation.   
					</p>
					<h4> Findings and Observations:</h4>
					<div class="list">
						<ol class="list">
							<li>Issues stemmed from the lack of a tracking system to know locations of busses at any given moment.</li> 
							<li>Riders frequently had to call dispatch to find out if busses were delayed or cancelled.  Dispatchers had to radio bus drivers on status and then contact riders with updated information.</li> 
							<li> JATA did not have route information easily accessible to riders.</br>
							a.	No route information at transit center</br>
							b.	Maps for purchase were kept behind the service desk
							</li>
						</ol>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="process">
				<h3>Guerilla Interviews with Bus Ridership</h3>
					<p class="voice">
					To better understand the problem from the rider’s perspective, informal interviews were conducted while riding JATA buses. Riders were interviewed to observe their experiences on riding the bus and how they find information about the JATA bus system. These comments and observations helped determine issues amongst riders.  
					</p>
					<h4> Findings and Observations:</h4>
					<div class="list">
						<ol class="list">
							<li>More than half of the riders surveyed were carrying smartphones, which contradicted the assumption of mobile illiteracy within Jackson</li> 
							<li>Frequent riders considered JATA's system easy to learn </li> 
							<li>Riders had difficulty determining when detours, delays, and cancellations were made to routes</li> 
							<li>Maps were unavailable at route stops and shelters</li>
						</ol>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="process">
				<h3>Defining the Problem:</h3>
					<p class="voice">Based on the results of the initial conversations, interviews, and meetings, we defined our problem:</p>
					<div class="list">
						<ol class="list">
							<li>JATA did not have an effective means of delivering information to its riders</li>
							<li>JATA lacked physical, digital, and instantaneous resources</li>
							<li>Current riders were unable to get updates and alerts</li>
							<li>Potential riders were unable to easily understand the JATA system</li>
						</ol>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="process">
				<h3>Deliverables Planning and Project Management:</h3>
					<p class="voice">Based on the results of the initial conversations, interviews, and meetings, we defined our problem:</p>
					<div class="list">
						<ol class="list">
							<li>Signage, guides, and system maps for bus stops and shelters</li>
							<li>Responsive website solely focused on route and system information, as well as, communication of alerts</li>
							<li>Increased involvement with social media for both engaging riders and providing updates</li>
						</ol>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="process">
				<h3>Sketches:</h3>
					<p class="voice">Sketches of the graphic signage and website were created to provide visuals to our partners. These provided quick feedback of how we planned to address the major issues addressed through our research. </p>

				<h3>Prototypes:</h3>
					<p class="voice">Once wireframes were discussed and critiqued, the next step was creating functional prototypes of higher-fidelity. These prototypes were intended to better understand the limitations of the media while helping to refine the execution of solutions. Information was shared with stakeholders at JATA who provided us on design insight, as well as, points of interests for maps.</p>

				</div>
				<div class="process">
				<h3>Development:</h3>
					<p class="voice">With prototypes approved, creation of the final signage deliverables was created utilizing, Adobe Illustrator and JATA maps. The website was developed utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. </p>
				</div>
				<div class="process">
				<h3>Outcome:</h3>
					<p class="voice">The route signage and website design were well received from Jackson residents and stakeholders during final presentations. Our research and solutions also received an award for the best community/service engagement project at the 2014 UMSI Exposition.
					During the summer of 2014, JATA plans to post signage at frequented stops and bus shelters throughout the city and the Illustrator files were presented to the marketing director for alterations if necessary.<br><br> 
					A sustainability plan was also created in order to ensure that our methods and design guidelines would be passed along to our partners and the process continued.
					Due to shifts in management and decision making within JATA which were outside of our project scope and control, the website deliverables were not implemented on the JATA website and instead a design by a third party contractor will be created.

					<h3> Overview: </h3>
					<p class = "goal"> The Global Information Engagement Program (GIEP) partners student teams with non-profit international organizations. My team partnered with the Indian Institute of Human Settlements (IIHS) in Bangalore, India from January 2014 to July 2014. The first phase of the project was conducted at the University of Michigan and required gathering research, and initial design iterations. The second phase was completed at the IIHS campus in Bangalore, where we finalized research and design, as well as, initiated development. </p>		
					<h3> My Responsibility:</h3>

					<h3> Problem: </h3>
					<p class="voice">The project addressed a need for storing, analyzing, and disseminating data about India’s urban centers. Currently IIHS has large data sets but no means of effectively allowing access and use of this information amongst IIHS researchers.</p>
					<h3> Goal: </h3>
					<p class="voice">Our team’s goal was to design and begin development for the Urban Informatics Portal, an interactive web application that visualizes datasets for Indian cities, districts, and states, both spatially and through charts.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="process">
					<h3> User Interviews, Personas, Scenarios: </h3>
					<p class="voice">Interviews were conducted with geographic information professionals, as well as, IIHS researchers. These interviews helped address the needs of the researchers and answered questions about how our application could realistically be used.</p>
					<h4> Key Insights: </h4>
					<div class="list">
						<ol class="list">
							<li>Data downloaded needs to be in specific formats and usable</li>
							<li>Main use of web applications is finding useful data, researchers use own resources for analysis</li>
							<li>Open source data, often researchers avoid or refuse to pay for data</li>
							<li>Difficulty gaining access to datasets collected by Indian Government</li>
							<li>Concern over repeating data collection conducted by other IIHS researchers</li>
						</ol>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="process">
					<h3>Comparitive Analysis:</h3>
					<p class="voice">To gain better insight into developing a geo-spatial web application, a comparative analysis was conducted. The sites analyzed were Transparent Chennai, Social Explorer and Census Explorer.  For each site, an interaction flow was completed. This provided a look at the designs implemented on similar interfaces and insight on possible features, interactions and design for the Urban Informatics Portal.</p>
